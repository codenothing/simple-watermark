# New Features
-Checks for native HTML5 placeholder capabilities first before implementing events
-Storing strings in the placeholder attribute will be used over the title attribute
-By default, the title attribute is removed after plugin initiation, to get rid of the native browser title hover bar
-Now preventing multiple initializations of the watermark plugin on the same element (storing data on simple-watermark data namespace)
